<h4>Key To Library Types</h4>
<ol>
<li>Builtin pure ruby eg boids</li>
<li>Builtin wrapping java eg video_event</li>
<li>Custom pure ruby</li>
<li>Custom java (see also pbox2d gem)</li>
<li>Regular processing libraries (see also gems for toxiclibs etc)</li>
</ol>

Since JRubyArt-2.0 you should configure the `library_path:` in `config.yml` to point to where you have your libraries folder. To use the processing built in libraries put the `pdf`, `serial` and `net` libraries in that folder.
